# P&O NO LOSSES – Fixed Irradiance Scenario

This folder contains simulation results for the Perturb and Observe (P&O) MPPT algorithm operating under constant irradiance. The aim is to observe convergence behavior and evaluate system response under ideal, stable conditions.

## ⚙️ Simulation Scenario

- Constant irradiance at 800 W/m²
- No shading or dynamic variation
- No power loss model included (ideal scenario)

## 📈 Key Observations

- **Fast Response**: PV current rapidly rises to ~28 A, recognized by the algorithm as the MPP.
- **Stable Operation**: After convergence, PV voltage, current, and output power remain stable.
- **Power Output**: The system delivers a constant 10.2 kW of real power after the initial transient.
- **DC-Link Voltage**: Reaches 1200 V quickly and stays regulated throughout.
- **Reactive Power**: Mean reactive power is close to zero, confirming unity power factor behavior.

## ⚠️ Note on MPP Accuracy

Although the P&O algorithm correctly locks onto the Global MPP in this scenario, this is coincidental. Under partial shading, P&O may incorrectly settle at a local MPP due to its inability to evaluate the global power landscape—this is a known limitation of heuristic MPPT techniques.
