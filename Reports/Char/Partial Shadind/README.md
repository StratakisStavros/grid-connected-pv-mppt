### I-V and P-V Curves under Partial Shading with Loss Compensation

These plots compare the I-V and P-V curves of a partially shaded PV system, with and without accounting for power losses due to converter and cabling resistances.

In the P-V curve, we observe the presence of multiple local maximaâ€”a typical outcome under partial shading. When power losses are considered, the global Maximum Power Point (MPP) shifts significantly. Initially, the true MPP is at 327 V and 14.6 kW, but after including losses, it moves to 535 V and 13.5 kW. This change highlights the importance of loss-aware MPPT algorithms, which can yield up to 5% more output power by targeting the actual optimal operating point.

In contrast, the I-V curves remain visually unchanged, since losses primarily affect power rather than current-voltage behavior.
