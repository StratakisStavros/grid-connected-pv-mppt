# üìÇ Simulink Models

This folder contains Simulink-based dynamic models of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems, developed to study the behavior of MPPT algorithms under different conditions such as partial shading, control dynamics, and real-time implementation.

Each model reflects a different scenario, configuration, or control architecture and is designed for integration with MPPT scripts from the `algorithms/` folder.

## üß™ Key Model Components

- **PV Module Simulation**: Models the electrical output of solar panels as a function of irradiance and temperature.
- **DC-DC Boost Converter**: Simulates power conversion between the PV array and DC link or grid interface.
- **MPPT Interface**: Most models allow connection with `.m`-based MPPT algorithms using MATLAB Function blocks or external scripts.
- **Control Framework**: Includes PLL synchronization, PI current control in the d-q frame, and pulse-width modulation (SPWM) blocks.
- **Bypass Diodes**: Included in some models to investigate partial shading and local/global MPP phenomena.
