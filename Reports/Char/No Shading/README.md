### I-V and P-V Characteristics without Shading (800–1000 W/m²)

These two plots represent the current-voltage (I-V) and power-voltage (P-V) characteristics of the PV array under three irradiance levels: 800 W/m², 900 W/m², and 1000 W/m², without shading.

As expected, higher irradiance leads to increased output current and total power, while the open-circuit voltage remains relatively stable (~715 V). The short-circuit currents are approximately 31.53 A, 35.47 A, and 39.41 A respectively. The Maximum Power Point (MPP) voltage remains nearly constant across scenarios, highlighting how irradiance primarily affects the current magnitude rather than operating voltage.

These curves are used as a baseline for comparison with MPPT algorithm behavior in both ideal and shaded conditions.
