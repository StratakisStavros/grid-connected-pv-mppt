### I-V and P-V Characteristics (800–1000 W/m²)

Two comparative plots showing the I-V and P-V curves of the PV system under three irradiance levels without partial shading.

- **File**: `P-V Characteristics 800,900,1000.png`
- **Scenario**: Unshaded PV array with varying irradiance
- **Observations**:
  - Maximum current increases proportionally with irradiance
  - Open-circuit voltage (~715 V) remains nearly constant
  - MPP voltage is stable, current shifts dominate the shape
